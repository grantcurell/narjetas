# Examples

Examples should be in the following format:

```javascript
[
    {
        weblink: "",
        sourceLanguage: "This is the definition in your native (or source) language.",
        targetLanguage: "This is the definition in your target language."
    }
]
```

The individual providers should populate these values.
